# mplayer.rb

With this library its possible to controll the great mplayer with ruby. This is done by using its slave-protocol.

##Usage

At the moment its very basic stuff. Just instanciate an MPlayer-object and send commands using the run-method:

```ruby
require 'mplayer'

#instanciate an object
player # MPlayer.new

#send commands to the mplayer
#start a song
player.run "loadfile '/path/to/song.mp3'"
#break playback
player.run "pause"
```

How i told, we just use mplayer slave-protocol. The communication goes through a named pipe (fifo-file). The creation of this fifo and the startup of mplayer is handled when a MPlayer-Instance is created. 

There is also some kind of logfile, which is nothing more than a file where all the stdout and stderr of the mplayer is piped in.

You can controll the path to the this files (the fifo and the logfile) by passing options when you instanciate the MPlayer-Object:

```ruby
require 'mplayer'

#create an object using options
player # MPlayer.new fifo: "/tmp/mysuperfifo",logfile: "/home/me/mysuperlogfile"
```

A list of commands that can be sent using the run-method can be found at http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/tech/slave.txt
